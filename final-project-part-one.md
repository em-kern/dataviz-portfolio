# Outline
 
My project focuses on ways post-industrial cities in the U.S. are reimagining vacant land use, and my own personal experience with one of the main ways to reuse vacant land, through building community gardens. Pittsburgh, Detroit, Cleveland, and many other legacy cities experienced huge population growth in the 1900s centered around major industries. Once those industries collapsed or moved to other regions in the world, these cities experienced huge population losses. Now these legacy cities have an aging housing stock and crumbling buildings, leading to demolition and vacant lots. Over the past few decades, Pittsburgh and other cities have been trying to make good use of these lots. Community gardens and greening efforts are one of the main ways these cities are trying to make use of vacant land.

Seven years ago, I joined my own local community garden, and found it really transformational. In my project, I want to share my own experience, highlight how powerful it can be to start growing your own food, and encourage others to get invested in their own neighborhoods and contribute to the revitalization of their cities. I plan to show the community gardens and vacant lots in Pittsburgh, give an idea of how abundant one garden plot can be, and plug some of the city's resources for getting involved. 

My structure:

1 - micro-scale: take the audience on a short immersive walk through my neighborhood, the landscape of vacant and occupied lots, and my old community garden

2 - scale up from neighborhood, to city, to country: describe how the vacant lots I see in Pittsburgh are matched in Detroit, X example city, Y example city. Go through short history of industry and population trends from 1950 to the present in these cities

3 - clear explanation of the struggles these cities face in revitalization after losing their populations. Economic downturn, aging housing stock, vacant lots

4 - What these cities have been doing about this issue over past decades? Finding new uses for vacant land: community gardens as prime example. 

5 - Describe my own journey of first joining a community garden, meeting my neighbors, growing my food.

6 - Go through myriad benefits to local gardening, how people feel about them, how they're low cost solutions to placemaking

7 - Explore vacant land programs in Pittsburgh and resources

8 - touch on the future of the city as new industries come in and housing demand rises, how we can continue to source local solutions while facing new problems.

# The data

I have public population data showing trends from 1950 to the present in various US cities, which I will use to explain the history of post-industrial cities. I have a few local data sources about vacant land and community garden resources in Pittsburgh. I plan to use these to map out vacant land, or to make a chart showing proportion of vacant land in the city. I have many sources about community gardens and their health/psychological/nutritional/placemaking benefits, which I will use to both pull standout statistics from, and to show the amount of food that plots can grow.

# Method and medium

I plan to use either Tableau or Datawrapper to create my charts, and Shorthand to put the whole story together. I may use GIS for some mapping. I have some photos of my own garden that I'd like to use, along with open source images.

# Wireframes / storyboards

I first built the structure of my storyboard through a google document, and then began working in shorthand to finalize the project:

# User research 

## Target audience
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story. 

My target audience is people who live in Rust Belt cities, who want to get more locally involved in their communities and help revitalize their cities. I reached out to classmates, who are new to Pittsburgh and mostly renters, and to a close friend, who has lived in the city a long time and owns a house.

## Interview script

My main goal was to see what the effect of my story was on others. Did it make sense to them, did they find it compelling? I went back and forth about the order of the story and how to connect the history of the Rust Belt with community gardening, and wanted to see what people thought.

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Determine flow and structure of story | Does this narrative make sense to you? Is there anything you would swap around? |
| Get feedback on topic | Do you find the subject interesting or compelling, and if not, what would make it more engaging? |
| See my blindspots | Is there anything missing? What are your overall impressions? |

| Questions               | Interview 1 - Public policy graduate student, female | Interview 2 - Information systems graduate student, female | Interview 3 - nurse, female, homeowner and local resident |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Does the flow/narrative make sense to you? | Flow was the biggest issue for this interviewee. It's confusing to go from local Pittsburgh, to a big national context, back to Pittsburgh, not what she was expecting. Suggestion to go from macro to micro, potentially. Start with vacant land overall. | Wants call to action could be earlier, or more signals to audience about why they should care. | Thinks benefits of community gardens should be moved earlier in the flow. |
| What are your thoughts on the subject? | Likes subject, wants to see more emphasis on benefits of community gardens (green space, shade, food, community). | Interesting, engaging, likes the personal resonance, and likes colors used. | Likes subject, brought up adding content on the importance of soil testing when gardening in urban areas, if I am advocating gardening to my audience. |
| What are your overall impressions? Anything else you'd like to see? | Rust color in color scheme too close to red, introduces red-green issues. Could be more brown/orange. | Likes the use of maps on different scales. Suggestion to use hazy data and point out a useful element within the haze. Also to add a title that hooks the audience by asking a question. | Possibility of introducing housing info. Pgh may have vacant land due to low population, but housing prices have risen rapidly in last few years because aging housing stock contributes to fewer usable homes. |


# Identified changes for Part III
> Document the changes you plan on implementing next week to address any issues identified.

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Findings or observations from interviews | Describe what, if any changes you anticipate making to address the observation. |
| The story structure doesn't fully make sense to my audience | I plan to play with a few options. I will definitely move the benefits of community gardens earlier in my story. I still think I will start local and go bigger, but I might try both ways and see which one sounds better. |
| Red-green color use could be an issue | For my rust color, I will use a more orange-brown rust, rather than reddish. I might also want to include a few pops of other colors through photos to make sure the color theme isn't too monotonous. |
| A few pieces of information could add audience understanding | Potential to add info about: environmental effects of local gardens, importance of soil testing for cities, and how housing prices can rise while the city still has so much vacant land. |


I was glad to get a lot of feedback about the flow of the story, as that was something I had been feeling confused about myself. My two main next steps are to reformat my story structure, and focus in on my charts, so that I'm presenting my data in a meaningful way.

# Moodboards / personas

I want to primarily use greens (gardening, revitalization, growth), rust/browns/reds (industry, deterioration, earth, red vegetables), and grey (background, iron, steel).
